# Exercises for Programmers
### by Brian Hogan

Exercise 10

Create a simple self-checkout system prompt for the prices and quantities of three items. Calculate the subtotal of the items. Then calculate the tax using a tax rate of 5.5%. Print out the line items with the quantity and total, and then print out the subtotal, tax amount and total.

#### Constraints:
* Keep the input, processing and output parts of your program separate. Collect the input then do the math operations and string building and then print out the output.
* Be sure you explicitly convert input to numerical data before doing any calculations.

#### Challenges:
* Revise the program to ensure the prices and quantities are entered as numeric values. Donâ€™t allow the user to proceed if the value entered is not numeric.
* Alter the program so that an indeterminate number of items can bantered. The tax and total are computed when there are no more items to be entered.
