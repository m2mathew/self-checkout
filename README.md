Exercise 10

Create a simple self checkout system prompt for the prices and quantities of three items. calculate the subtotal of the items. then calculate the tax using a tax rate of 5.5%. print out the line items with the quantity and total, and then print out the subtotal, tax amount and total.

### Constraints:
* Keep the input, processing and output parts of your program separate. collect the input then do the math operations and string building and then print out the output.
* Be sure you explicitly convert input to numerical data before doing any calculations.

### Challenges:
* Revise the program to ensure to prices and quantities are enter as numeric values. donâ€™t allow the user to proceed if the value entered is not numeric.
* After the program so that an indeterminate number of items can bantered. the tax and total are computed when there are no more items to be entered.
